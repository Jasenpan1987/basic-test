# This is a boiler plate for creating and publishing typescript npm packages

## You need to run `npm run build` before push it to your git repository

## If you need to use other npm packages, try to put it into peer dependencies

## To install this package from github, you can do `npm install --save git+<Your Repository Url>.git`
